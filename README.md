# Requirements
* python
* selenium
* Chrome or Mozilla

# How to use it
* Log in to your asu, enroll to best option available.
* Go to swap courses, then select the course which you want to swap with, and then click OK and just leave the page at the final submission page.
* Then run the mainGUI.py file : It will keep refreshing your swap course page until your session expire. The script will run one more chrome window to track open courses.
* The selenium code is configured for 1680 x 1050 resolution, feel free to adjust according to your screen.
* Add the courses accordingly and seats count for that in the course_helper_selenium.py.
* Note : Use this once reserved seats are open as reserved seats are returned in open filter. 

# Use Case
I used this to flick all the top demanded courses at ASU like SWM by Prof. Hasan, all the courses by Prof. Sameera and many more through out Fall 2022 to Spring 2024.
